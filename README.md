# Backend for Simpill

Our product is a pill advisor which simplifies the process of choosing the appropriate supplement for user's symptoms. The user can input their symptoms and the system will recommend the most suitable supplement for them. The system will also provide information about the supplement and its side effects. The user can also search for supplements and get information about them.

The backend is a RESTful API that provides the necessary endpoints to interact with the database.
