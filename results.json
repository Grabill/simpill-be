Some chemicals in honey might kill certain bacteria and fungus. When applied to the skin, honey might serve as a barrier to moisture and keep skin from sticking to wound dressings. It might also provide nutrients and chemicals that speed wound healing. But honey can become contaminated with germs during production. Although rare, some infants have gotten botulism from taking honey by mouth.  People commonly use honey for burns, wound healing, swelling and sores inside the mouth, and cough. It is also used for many other conditions but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. There is also no good evidence to support using honey for COVID-19.

People get magnesium from their diet, but sometimes magnesium supplements are needed if magnesium levels are too low. Low magnesium levels in the body have been linked to diseases such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, clogged arteries, hereditary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. An easy way to remember foods that are good magnesium sources is to think of fiber. Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium. Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. Water with a high mineral content, or \"hard\" water, is also a source of magnesium. Magnesium is most commonly used for constipation, as an antacid for heartburn, for low magnesium levels, for pregnancy complications called pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, and for a certain type of irregular heartbeat (torsades de pointes). ",
            "uses": "Effective for Bowel preparation. Taking magnesium by mouth is helpful for preparing the bowel for medical procedures. Effective for Constipation. Taking magnesium by mouth is helpful as a laxative for constipation. Effective for Indigestion (dyspepsia). Taking magnesium by mouth as an antacid reduces symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. Various magnesium compounds can be used, but magnesium hydroxide seems to work the fastest. Effective for Seizures in women with eclampsia. Administering magnesium intravenously (by IV) or as a shot is considered the treatment of choice for eclampsia. Administering magnesium reduces the risk of seizures in those with this condition. Effective for Low levels of magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesemia). Taking magnesium supplements can treat and prevent magnesium deficiency. Magnesium deficiency can occur when people have liver disorders, heart failure, vomiting or diarrhea, kidney dysfunction, and other conditions. Effective for A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Administering magnesium intravenously (by IV) or as a shot is considered the treatment of choice for preventing seizures in females with pre-eclampsia. But taking magnesium by mouth doesn't seem to reduce the risk for pre-eclampsia in healthy adults.Likely Effective for Cerebral palsy. The best evidence to date shows that giving intravenous (IV) magnesium to pregnant patients before a preterm birth can reduce the risk of cerebral palsy in the infant. Likely Effective for Seizures. Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) is helpful for treating various types of seizures. Likely Effective for A type of irregular heartbeat (torsades de pointes). Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) is helpful for treating a certain type of irregular heartbeat called torsades de pointes.Possibly Effective for Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias). Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) or by mouth seems to be helpful for treating irregular heartbeat, also called arrhythmias. It is not yet clear whether magnesium helps reduce irregular heartbeat after heart surgery. Possibly Effective for Asthma. Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) seems to help treat sudden asthma attacks. It might be more beneficial in children than in adults. But inhaling magnesium or taking magnesium by mouth doesn't seem to work. Possibly Effective for Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Research shows that eating more foods with magnesium in them is linked to a reduced risk of colon and rectal cancer. But other research suggests that magnesium might reduce colon cancer risk, but not rectal cancer risk. Possibly Effective for Diabetes. Eating a diet with more magnesium is linked with a reduced risk of developing diabetes in adults and overweight children. Research in people existing type 2 diabetes is conflicting. However, magnesium supplements might be most helpful in people with type 2 diabetes and low magnesium levels. In people who developed diabetes during pregnancy, taking magnesium seems to improve sensitivity to insulin and reduce the levels of sugar in the blood. Possibly Effective for High cholesterol. Taking magnesium chloride and magnesium oxide appears to slightly decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL or \"bad\") and total cholesterol levels, and slightly increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL or \"good\") cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. There is also some evidence that magnesium might lower blood fats called triglycerides in people with high triglyceride levels. Possibly Effective for A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). People with low magnesium levels are 6-7 times more likely to have metabolic syndrome than people with normal magnesium levels. Higher magnesium intake from diet and supplements is linked with a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome in healthy adults. Possibly Effective for Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Taking magnesium by mouth seems to prevent bone loss in older females with osteoporosis. Possibly Effective for Pain after surgery. When administered with anesthesia or given to people after surgery, magnesium seems to increase the amount of time before pain develops and might decrease the need to use pain relievers after surgery. Giving magnesium intravenously (by IV) seems to help reduce pain after a surgical procedure to remove the uterus called a hysterectomy.
