Niacinamide is required for the function of fats and sugars in the body and to maintain healthy cells. Niacin is converted to niacinamide when it is taken in amounts greater than what is needed by the body. Unlike niacin, niacinamide doesn't help treat high cholesterol. People use niacinamide to prevent vitamin B3 deficiency and related conditions such as pellagra. It is also used for acne, diabetes, cancer, osteoarthritis, aging skin, skin discoloration, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Do not confuse niacinamide with niacin, NADH, nicotinamide riboside, inositol nicotinate, or L-tryptophan. These are not the same.",

But having too much phenylalanine during pregnancy can increase the chance of birth defects. For patients who process phenylalanine normally and have normal levels, it is fine to consume phenylalanine in typical food amounts, but supplements containing phenylalanine should be avoided. For pregnant patients who have high levels of phenylalanine, such as those with a condition called phenylketonuria (PKU), even normal food amounts are unsafe. For these patients, experts recommend a low phenylalanine diet for at least 20 weeks before getting pregnant. This should reduce the risk of birth defects.

Red yeast rice contains ten different chemicals known as monacolins. These chemicals affect cholesterol levels. Monacolin K, which is the same as the drug lovastatin, is the most abundant in red yeast rice. Because of this, it has many of the same effects and precautions as the statin drug. People most commonly use red yeast rice for high levels of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. It is also used for heart attack, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses. The US FDA considers red yeast rice products that contain significant amounts of statin-like ingredients to be illegal, unapproved drugs. But many of these products are still available. Red yeast rice products do not always contain consistent amounts of statins, which can change their effects on health.",

            "overview": "Phosphorus is an essential mineral found in many foods. In the diet and body, phosphorus usually binds to other minerals in the form of phosphate salts. Phosphates are involved in cell structure, energy transport and storage, vitamin function, and many other essential processes in the body. Phosphate salts can act as laxatives by causing more fluid to be drawn into the intestines and making the gut push out its contents faster. People use phosphate salts for bowel cleansing, low blood levels of phosphate, constipation, high blood levels of calcium, and heartburn. They are also used for athletic performance, osteoporosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.",
            "uses": "Effective for Emptying the colon before a colonoscopy. Taking sodium phosphate products by mouth before a colonoscopy is effective for bowel cleansing. Some sodium phosphate products are approved by the US FDA for this use. But taking sodium phosphate can increase the risk of kidney damage in some people and should be used with caution. Low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphatemia). Taking sodium or potassium phosphate by mouth or by IV is effective for preventing or treating low phosphate levels in the blood. IV products can only be given by a healthcare provider. Likely Effective for Constipation. Sodium phosphate is an FDA-approved over-the-counter (OTC) ingredient for treating constipation. OTC products are taken by mouth or used as enemas. Indigestion (dyspepsia). Aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are FDA-approved ingredients in OTC antacids. High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). Taking phosphate salts by mouth is likely effective for treating high levels of calcium in the blood. But calcium phosphate should not be used since it contains calcium and can increase calcium levels. Possibly Effective for Kidney stones. Taking potassium phosphate by mouth can help prevent calcium kidney stones from forming in people with high urine levels of calcium. There is interest in using phosphate salts for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.",
            "side_effects": "When taken by mouth: Phosphate salts are likely safe when consumed in the diet, or when supplements are used appropriately for a short time.

Phosphate salts (as phosphorous) are possibly unsafe when taken in doses higher than 4 grams daily for adults 70 years and younger, or in doses higher than 3 grams daily for people over 70 years. Regular long-term use can upset the balance of phosphates and other chemicals in the body and should be monitored by a healthcare professional to avoid serious side effects. When given as an enema (rectally): Phosphate salts are likely safe for most people when inserted into the rectum appropriately and short-term. But these products shouldn't be used more than once daily.",

Children: Phosphate salts are commonly consumed in the diet. Phosphate salts are possibly unsafe when taken in amounts that exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 3 grams daily for children 1-8 years old and 4 grams daily for children 9 years and older. Giving a sodium phosphate enema to children OVER 2 years of age is likely safe when no more than one dose is given every 24 hours. But it is likely unsafe to give more than one dose every 24 hours, or to give a sodium phosphate enema to children who are under 2 years of age. Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions:: Sodium phosphate can cause damage to the intestines in some people. If you have an obstruction or have an inflammatory GI condition, avoid using sodium phosphate. High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia):: Use phosphate salts cautiously if you have hypercalcemia. Too much phosphate could cause calcium to be deposited where it shouldn't be in your body. High levels of phosphate in the blood: People with Addison's disease, severe heart and lung disease, kidney disease, thyroid problems, or liver disease are more likely to have too much phosphate in their blood when they take phosphate salts.

Soy contains isoflavones which are changed in the body to phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogen molecules are similar in chemical structure to the hormone estrogen. In some cases, these phytoestrogens can mimic the effects of estrogen. In other cases, these phytoestrogens can block the effects of estrogen. Soy is used for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, symptoms of menopause, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.",

But taking soy supplements doesn't seem to help. Long-term kidney disease (chronic kidney disease or CKD). Taking soy protein by mouth seems to reduce protein in the urine and other measures of kidney function in people with CKD. Diabetes. Eating a diet high in soy seems to reduce the risk of developing diabetes. It is unclear if eating a diet high in soy reduces the risk of developing gestational diabetes. It is also unclear if taking soy protein improves blood sugar or cholesterol levels in people who already have diabetes. Diarrhea. Feeding infants with formula supplemented with soy fiber seems to reduce diarrhea. But taking soy by IV doesn't seem to reduce diarrhea in adults. IV products can only be given by a healthcare provider. An inherited disorder in which the body is unable to properly digest the sugar galactose (galactosemia). Feeding a soy-based formula to infants who have galactosemia might help to reduce symptoms. High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Eating soy protein in place of other dietary protein or using soy fiber products seems to slightly reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or bad) cholesterol. But taking supplements containing purified soy isoflavones by mouth don't seem to help. High blood pressure. Eating soy protein seems to reduce blood pressure by a small amount in people with slightly high blood pressure. Inability to properly digest the sugar lactose (lactose intolerance). Feeding a soy-based formula to infants who have lactose intolerance might help to reduce symptoms. Symptoms of menopause. Eating soy protein or taking soy isoflavone extracts by mouth seems to help reduce hot flashes caused by menopause in some people. A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Eating soy protein products helps lower blood sugar levels and improve other measures of the disease in people with metabolic syndrome. Muscle strength. Taking soy protein by mouth seems to increase muscle strength. It seems to work as well as whey protein, dairy protein, and beef protein. Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Taking soy protein or soy extract by mouth can increase bone mineral density (BMD) or slow BMD loss in females near or beyond menopause. Possibly Ineffective for Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Taking soy by mouth doesn't seem to improve urination or other symptoms in people with an enlarged prostate. Hot flashes in people treated for breast cancer. Taking soy by mouth doesn't reduce hot flashes related to breast cancer. Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Taking soy by mouth does not reduce the risk for colorectal cancer. Muscle soreness caused by exercise. Taking soy isoflavone extract by mouth before exercising doesn't seem to prevent muscle soreness.

However, soy is possibly unsafe when used in the larger amounts found in medicine when pregnant. Higher doses during pregnancy might harm development of the baby. Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if soy is safe to use in the larger amounts found in medicine when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Children: Soy is commonly consumed in foods. Giving infants soy formula doesn't seem to cause health or reproductive problems later in life. But soy milk that is not designed for infants should not be used as a substitute for infant formula. Regular soy milk could lead to nutrient deficiencies. Soy is possibly unsafe when used as an alternative to cow's milk in children who are allergic to cow's milk. Although soy protein-based infant formulas are often promoted for children with milk allergy, these children are often allergic to soy as well. Don't give children soy in amounts larger than what is found in food or formula. Researchers don't know whether soy is safe for children at higher doses. Breast cancer: The effects of soy in people with breast cancer are unclear. Because there isn't enough reliable information about the effects of soy in females with breast cancer, a history of breast cancer, or a family history of breast cancer, it's best to avoid using soy supplements until more is known. Allergy to peanuts and related plants: Soy might cause serious allergic reactions in people who are allergic to peanuts and other members of the Fabaceae plant family. Under-active thyroid (hypothyroidism): Some people with this condition also have low iodine levels. Taking soy might make this condition worse in people who have low iodine levels. Kidney failure: Soy contains a chemical called phytoestrogens. People with kidney failure who use soy products might have blood levels of phytoestrogens become too high. If you have kidney failure, avoid taking large amounts of soy. Kidney stones: Soy products might increase the risk of kidney stones. Soy products contain large amounts of chemicals called oxalates. Oxalates are the main ingredient in kidney stones. If you have a history of kidney stones, avoid taking large amounts of soy.
