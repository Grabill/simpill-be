asparagus, certain fruits, beans, yeast, mushrooms, animal liver and kidney, orange juice, and tomato juice. folic acid is also available as a supplement, and is often used in combination with other b vitamins. folic acid is used for preventing and treating low blood levels of folate (folate deficiency) and high blood levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia). people who are pregnant or might become pregnant take folic acid to prevent serious birth defects such as spina bifida. folic acid is also used for many other conditions including depression, stroke, decline in memory and thinking

coenzyme q10 can also be made in a laboratory. coenzyme q10 is most commonly used for conditions that affect the heart such as heart failure and fluid build up in the body (congestive heart failure or chf), chest pain (angina), and high blood pressure. it is also used for preventing migraine headache, parkinson disease, and many other conditions. coenzyme q10 was first identified in 1957. the q10 refers to the chemical make-up of the substance.likely effective for coenzyme q10 deficiency. taking coenzyme q10 by mouth seems to improve symptoms of coenzyme q10 deficiency. this is a very rare condition. the symptoms include weakness, fatigue, and seizures. a group of disorders that most often cause muscle weakness (mitochondrial myopathies). taking coenzyme q10 by mouth seems to reduce symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies. however, improvement in symptoms is slow. some people have to take coenzyme q10 for 6 months to get the most benefit. possibly effective for heart failure and fluid build up in the body (congestive heart failure or chf). early research found that heart failure might be linked with low coenzyme q10 levels. some research shows that taking coenzyme q10 might help reduce some symptoms of heart failure. coenzyme q10 might also reduce the chances of death or hospitalization related to heart failure. nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). research shows that taking coenzyme q10 improves nerve damage and nerve pain in people with nerve damage caused by diabetes. fibromyalgia. some research shows that taking coenzyme q10 by mouth reduces pain, tenderness, fatigue, and sleep issues in people with fibromyalgia. tissue damage caused when there is limited blood flow and then blood flow is restored (ischemia-reperfusion injury). reduced blood supply during heart or blood vessel surgery can deprive tissue of oxygen. when blood supply returns to this tissue, the tissue can become damaged. there is some evidence that taking coenzyme q10 by mouth for at least one week before heart bypass surgery or blood vessel surgery might help to reduce tissue damage. however, not all research agrees with this finding. migraine. taking coenzyme q10

taking coenzyme q10 for lowering total cholesterol or ldl or increasing hdl (or good cholesterol) levels. it may take at least 3 months to see any benefit. high blood pressure. some research shows that taking coenzyme q10 by itself or along with other medications for treating high blood pressure helps lowers blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. however, not all research has shown benefit. coenzyme q10 might only benefit people with high blood pressure who also have diabetes or low blood levels of coenzyme q10 before treatment. taking coenzyme q10 by mouth daily appears to

inability to become pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (infertility). although coenzyme q10 might increase the chance of getting pregnant, it might not reduce miscarriage or increase successful pregnancies in women with this condition. kidney failure. some early research suggests that taking coenzyme q10 improves kidney function in people with kidney failure. but it might not be helpful in people with less severe kidney disease. conditions in a man that prevent him from getting a woman pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (male infertility). there is some early evidence that taking coenzyme q10 or an altered form of coenzyme q10 called ubiquinol by mouth for 3-6 months can improve the movement and density of sperm in men with certain types of infertility. it's unclear if these improvements increase pregnancy rate. an inherited form of diabetes that is linked with deafness. early research suggests that taking coenzyme q10 by mouth might prevent the progression of a rare form of diabetes that is inherited from the mother. build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or nafld). early research shows that taking coenzyme q10 can improve markers of liver injury and disease severity in people with nafld. obesity. taking coenzyme q10 does not seem to help with weight loss. parkinson disease. some research shows that taking coenzyme q10 by itself or along with other supplements might slow mental decline in people with early-stage parkinson disease. at least 16 months of treatment

or an age-related phenomenon. a pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). pre-eclampsia is a condition that some women develop during pregnancy. some research shows that women who are at risk have a lower chance of developing the condition if they take coenzyme q10 from week 20 of pregnancy until the baby is delivered. schizophrenia. it is unclear if taking coenzyme q10 improves symptoms in people with schizophrenia. blood infection (sepsis). some early research shows that taking coenzyme q10 might prevent death in people with blood

islamic, and christian mythology and writings. it is described in records dating from around 1500 bce as a treatment for tapeworm and other parasites. many cultures use pomegranate as a folk medicine. pomegranate is native to iran. it is primarily cultivated in mediterranean counties, parts of the united states, afghanistan, russia, india, china, and japan. you'll see pomegranate in some royal and medical coats of arms.possibly effective for high blood pressure. some research shows that drinking pomegranate juice daily can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by about 5 mmhg. lower

        "description": "magnesium is a mineral that is important for normal bone structure in the body. people get magnesium from their diet, but sometimes magnesium supplements are needed if magnesium levels are too low. low magnesium levels in the body have been linked to diseases such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, clogged arteries, hereditary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. an easy way to remember foods that are good magnesium sources is to think of fiber. foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium. dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. water with a high mineral content, or hard water, is also a source of magnesium. magnesium is most commonly used for constipation, as an antacid for heartburn, for low magnesium levels, for pregnancy complications called pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, and for a certain type of irregular heartbeat (torsades de pointes).effective for bowel preparation. taking magnesium by mouth is helpful for preparing the bowel for medical procedures. constipation. taking magnesium by mouth is helpful as a laxative for constipation. indigestion (dyspepsia). taking magnesium by mouth as an antacid reduces symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. various magnesium compounds can be used, but magnesium hydroxide seems to work the fastest. seizures in women with eclampsia. administering magnesium intravenously (by iv) or as a shot is considered the treatment of choice for eclampsia. administering magnesium reduces the risk of seizures in those with this condition. low levels of magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesemia). taking magnesium supplements can treat and prevent magnesium deficiency. magnesium deficiency can occur when people have liver disorders, heart failure, vomiting or diarrhea, kidney dysfunction, and other conditions. a pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). administering magnesium intravenously (by iv) or as a shot is considered the treatment of choice for preventing seizures in females with pre-eclampsia. but taking magnesium by mouth doesn't seem to reduce the risk for pre-eclampsia in healthy adults. likely effective for cerebral palsy. the best evidence to date shows that giving intravenous (iv) magnesium to pregnant patients before a preterm birth can reduce the risk of cerebral palsy in the infant. seizures. giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) is helpful for treating various types of seizures. a type of irregular heartbeat (torsades de pointes). giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) is helpful for treating a certain type of irregular heartbeat called torsades de pointes. possibly effective for irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias). giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) or by mouth seems to be helpful for treating irregular heartbeat, also called arrhythmias. it is not yet clear whether magnesium helps reduce irregular heartbeat after heart surgery. asthma. giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) seems to help treat sudden asthma attacks. it might be more beneficial in children than in adults. but inhaling magnesium or taking magnesium by mouth doesn't seem to work. colon cancer, rectal cancer. research shows that eating more foods with magnesium in them is linked to a reduced risk of colon and rectal cancer. but other research suggests that magnesium might reduce colon cancer risk, but not rectal cancer risk. diabetes. eating a diet with more magnesium is linked with a reduced risk of developing diabetes in adults and overweight children. research in people existing type 2 diabetes is conflicting. however, magnesium supplements might be most helpful in people with type 2 diabetes and low magnesium levels. in people who developed diabetes during pregnancy, taking magnesium seems to improve sensitivity to insulin and reduce the levels of sugar in the blood. high cholesterol. taking magnesium chloride and magnesium oxide appears to slightly decrease low-density lipoprotein (ldl or bad) and total cholesterol levels, and slightly increase in high-density lipoprotein (hdl or good) cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. there is also some evidence that magnesium might lower blood fats called triglycerides in people with high triglyceride levels. a grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). people with low magnesium levels are 6-7 times more likely to have metabolic syndrome than people with normal magnesium levels. higher magnesium intake from diet and supplements is linked with a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome in healthy adults. weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). taking magnesium by mouth seems to prevent bone loss in older females with osteoporosis. pain after surgery. when administered with anesthesia or given to people after surgery, magnesium seems to increase the amount of time before pain develops and might decrease the need to use pain relievers after surgery. giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) seems to help reduce pain after a surgical procedure to remove the uterus called a hysterectomy. but magnesium does not seem to help reduce pain in children after tonsil removal. premenstrual syndrome (pms). taking magnesium by mouth seems to relieve symptoms of pms, including mood changes and bloating. taking magnesium by mouth also seems to prevent premenstrual migraines. chest pain due to blood vessel spasms (vasospastic angina). giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) seems to prevent blood vessel spasms in people with chest pain caused by spasms in the artery that supplies blood to the heart. possibly ineffective for altitude sickness. taking magnesium citrate by mouth doesn't reduce the risk of altitude sickness. athletic performance. taking magnesium by mouth doesn't increase energy or endurance during athletic activity. swelling (inflammation) of small airways in the lung (bronchiolitis). giving magnesium by iv does not help and might even worsen bronchiolitis in infants. iv products can only be given by a healthcare provider. nerve damage in the hands and feet caused by cancer drug treatment. taking magnesium does not prevent nerve damage caused by the cancer drug oxaliplatin. limb pain that usually occurs after an injury (complex regional pain syndrome). taking magnesium by iv does not improve pain in people with chronic pain after an injury. iv products can only be given by a healthcare provider. confusion and agitation after surgery. taking magnesium by iv does not seem to reduce delirium after surgery. iv products can only be given by a healthcare provider. symptoms of menopause. taking magnesium oxide by mouth doesn't reduce hot flashes. muscle cramps. taking magnesium supplements by mouth does not seem to decrease the frequency or intensity of muscle cramps. sickle cell disease. giving magnesium sulfate by iv does not benefit children with sickle cell disease who are in the hospital. iv products can only be given by a healthcare provider. stillbirth. taking magnesium supplements by mouth during pregnancy does not seem to decrease the risk of a stillbirth. a serious infection caused by clostridium bacteria (tetanus). taking magnesium by iv does not seem to reduce the risk of death in people with tetanus. iv products can only be given by a healthcare provider. a sudden injury that causes damage to the brain (traumatic brain injury). treatment with magnesium does not improve the outcome or reduce the risk of death for people with a traumatic brain injury. it's not clear if taking magnesium by mouth is helpful in people with a concussion. there is interest in using magnesium for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful. insufficient evidence for alcohol use disorder. taking magnesium by mouth seems to improve sleep quality in people who are dependent on alcohol and going through withdrawal. however, injecting magnesium as a shot does not seem to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms. attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (adhd). children with adhd seem to have lower magnesium levels. early research suggests that magnesium might be helpful for children with adhd who have low magnesium levels. back pain. early research suggests that receiving magnesium intravenously (by iv) every 4 hours for 2 weeks while taking magnesium by mouth daily for 4 weeks reduces pain in people with chronic low back pain. bipolar disorder. early research suggests that taking a certain magnesium product (magnesiocard) may have similar effects as lithium in some people with bipolar disorder. other early research suggests that taking magnesium by mouth along with the drug verapamil reduces manic symptoms better than verapamil alone in people with bipolar disorder. also, giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) seems to reduce the dose of other drugs needed to manage severe manic symptoms. nerve pain in people with cancer. giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) seems to help relieve pain caused by nerve damage due to cancer. damage to the immune system caused by cancer drug treatment. early research shows that taking magnesium by mouth might prevent immune system damage in children receiving the cancer drug cisplatin. sudden loss of heart function (cardiac arrest). some preliminary research suggests that higher levels of magnesium are linked with a lower chance of cardiac arrest. however, it is not known if taking a magnesium supplement reduces the risk of cardiac arrest. giving magnesium intravenously does not seem to have a benefit. heart disease (cardiovascular disease). it is unclear if people who get more magnesium as part of their diet have a lower chance of heart disease. some research has found that increasing magnesium intake in the diet is linked to a reduced risk of death related to heart disease. but other research has found no benefit. chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs). administering magnesium as a shot might improve symptoms of fatigue. but not all research agrees. a lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd). administering magnesium intravenously (by iv) seems to help sudden copd symptoms. also, taking magnesium using an inhaler, along with the drug salbutamol, seems to reduce sudden copd symptoms better than salbutamol alone. cluster headache. early research shows that giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) might relieve cluster headaches. heart disease (coronary heart disease). early research shows that taking magnesium by mouth might reduce blood clots in people with heart disease. depression. it is unclear if people who get more magnesium as part of their diet have a lower chance of depression. it is also too early to know if magnesium can reduce symptoms in people with depression. taking magnesium by mouth for 6 weeks seems to reduce mild to moderate depression in adults. but getting a single dose of magnesium intravenously (by iv) doesn't reduce depression symptoms when measured one week later. confusion and agitation after surgery. early research suggests that iv magnesium does not reduce confusion and agitation in children after surgery. muscle soreness caused by exercise. early research suggests that taking magnesium for 10 days might reduce muscle soreness after lifting weights. fibromyalgia. early research shows that taking magnesium citrate daily for 8 weeks might improve some symptoms of fibromyalgia. fractures. people who get more magnesium from their diet or as supplements seem to have a lower risk of fractures. stomach cancer. people who get more magnesium from their diet or as supplements do not seem to have a lower risk of stomach cancer. hearing loss. taking magnesium by mouth seems to prevent hearing loss in people exposed to loud noise. also, taking magnesium seems to improve hearing loss in people with sudden hearing loss that is not from loud noise. high blood pressure. most research shows that taking magnesium can lower diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number in a blood pressure reading) by about 2 mmhg. this decrease might be too small to have a meaningful impact on high blood pressure. there's conflicting data about the effects of magnesium on systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading). insomnia. magnesium might reduce insomnia in the elderly. but it doesn't seem to improve sleep in people without insomnia. bleeding into or around the fluid-filled areas (ventricles) of the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage). early research suggests that premature infants might have a lower risk of a brain bleed if their mothers receive magnesium by iv while pregnant. kidney stones. some research shows that taking magnesium by mouth might prevent kidney stones in people who have had kidney stones. liver cancer. people who get more magnesium from their diet seem to have a lower risk of liver cancer. migraine. taking high doses of magnesium by mouth might help prevent migraines and make them a little less severe. but not all research agrees. iv magnesium might relieve migraines in people that don't get enough magnesium in their diet. heart attack. in general, giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) or taking magnesium by mouth does not seem to reduce the overall risk of death after a heart attack. brain damage in infants caused by lack of oxygen. research suggests that administering magnesium intravenously (by iv) might improve outcomes in infants with brain damage caused by lack of oxygen in the short-term. but it doesn't seem to have long-term benefit. obesity. it is unclear if taking magnesium by mouth improves weight loss in obese people. if it does, any benefits are likely to be small. death from any cause. consuming more magnesium in the diet is linked to a lower risk of death. however, taking magnesium supplements does not seem to reduce this risk. pain (chronic). people who get more magnesium from their diet or supplements seem to have a slightly lower risk of chronic pain. physical performance in elderly adults. some research shows that taking magnesium daily for 12 weeks might help elderly females to walk further. a hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or pcos). taking magnesium does not seem to reduce insulin resistance in pcos. leg cramps in women who are pregnant. most research shows that taking magnesium by mouth might reduce leg cramps during pregnancy. but not all research agrees. preterm birth. giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) might prevent contractions when premature labor occurs. some research suggests that magnesium is more effective at delaying labor by 48 hours compared to some conventional drugs. but not all experts believe it is beneficial, and some research suggests it might cause more adverse effects. a rare, inherited disorder that causes buildup of minerals in the skin, eyes, and blood vessels (pseudoxanthoma elasticum or pxe). early research suggests that magnesium supplementation might reduce buildup of minerals in people with pxe. a disorder that causes leg discomfort and an irresistible urge to move the legs (restless legs syndrome or rls). taking magnesium by mouth might decrease the amount of movement and increase the amount of sleep in patients with restless legs syndrome. however, the role of magnesium, if any, in restless legs syndrome is uncertain. some people with this condition have high levels of magnesium in their blood, while others have low magnesium levels. stroke. most early research found that increased intake of magnesium in the diet is linked with a reduced risk of death from stroke. there is also some evidence that increased dietary intake of magnesium seems to improve mental ability in people after stroke. but the effects of intravenous (iv) magnesium are mixed. some research shows that it might protect the brain after stroke. but other research shows that it does not reduce the risk of death or disability in most people. bleeding in the space surrounding the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage). there is mixed evidence about the effect of magnesium in managing bleeding in the brain. some research suggests that giving magnesium intravenously (by iv) reduces the risk of death and vegetative state. however, other research does not support these findings. allergic rhinitis. hay fever. urinary incontinence. other conditions. more evidence is needed to rate
