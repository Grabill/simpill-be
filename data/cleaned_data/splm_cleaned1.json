Pectin binds substances in the intestines and adds bulk to the stools. It might also reduce how much cholesterol the body absorbs from foods. People use pectin for high cholesterol, prediabetes, heartburn, diarrhea, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Pectin was used for years together with kaolin (Kaopectate) to control diarrhea. But in 2003, the FDA found that evidence doesn't support the use of pectin for diarrhea. Since April 2004, pectin has not been permitted as an anti-diarrhea agent in over-the-counter (OTC) products. Kaopectate no longer contains pectin and kaolin.",

        "name": "GREEN TEA",
        "overview": "Green tea is made from the Camellia sinensis plant. Its dried leaves and leaf buds are used to make several different teas, including black and oolong teas. Green tea is prepared by steaming and pan-frying the Camellia sinensis leaves and then drying them. Green tea is not fermented, so it's able to maintain important molecules called polyphenols, which seem to be responsible for many of its benefits. It also contains caffeine. People commonly use a US FDA-approved prescription product containing green tea for genital warts. As a drink or supplement, green tea is sometimes used for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, to prevent heart disease, and to prevent ovarian cancer. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.",
        "uses": "Likely Effective for A sexually transmitted infection that can lead to genital warts or cancer (human papillomavirus or HPV). A specific green tea extract ointment (Polyphenon E ointment 15%) is available as a prescription product for treating genital warts. Applying the ointment for 10-16 weeks seems to clear these types of warts in 24% to 60% of patients. Possibly Effective for Heart disease. Drinking green tea is linked to a reduced risk of clogged arteries. The link seems to be stronger in males than in females. Also, people who drink at least three cups of green tea daily might have a lower risk of death from heart disease. Cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer). Drinking green tea is linked to a reduced risk of developing endometrial cancer. High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Taking green tea by mouth seems to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL or bad) cholesterol by a small amount. Ovarian cancer. Regularly drinking tea green seems to reduce the risk for ovarian cancer. There is interest in using green tea for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.",
        "side_effects": "When taken by mouth: Green tea is commonly consumed as a beverage. Drinking green tea in moderate amounts (about 8 cups daily) is likely safe for most people. Green tea extract is possibly safe when taken for up to 2 years or when used as a mouthwash, short-term. Drinking more than 8 cups of green tea daily is possibly unsafe. Drinking large amounts might cause side effects due to the caffeine content. These side effects can range from mild to serious and include headache and irregular heartbeat. Green tea extract also contains a chemical that has been linked with liver injury when used in high doses. When applied to the skin: Green tea extract is likely safe when an FDA-approved ointment is used, short-term. Other green tea products are possibly safe when used appropriately.",

It is also used for flu, dry eye, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using N-acetyl cysteine for COVID-19. Although many dietary supplement products contain N-acetyl cysteine, the US FDA has stated that it's illegal for dietary supplements to contain N-acetyl cysteine since it's technically an approved drug. But as of August 2022, the FDA is considering changing this stance. It may allow for N-acetyl cysteine in dietary supplements as long as no safety issues come up. A final decision is pending. Prescription N-acetyl cysteine products are available under the guidance of a healthcare provider.",

        "overview": "The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, very low-carb diet. It usually limits carbs to 20-50 grams daily. This forces the body to break down fat for energy. The body breaks down fat into molecules called ketone bodies. These ketone bodies can be used for energy. The classical ketogenic diet, which is used to reduce seizures in children, requires up to 4 times as many calories from fat as from carbohydrate and protein. A very strict form of the ketogenic diet is used for seizure disorders in people with hard-to-treat epilepsy. Less strict forms of the ketogenic diet are used for obesity, diabetes, Parkinson disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. Don't confuse the Modified Atkins Diet, a type of ketogenic diet, with the Atkins diet. Also don't confuse the ketogenic diet with Keto diet pills. These are not the same and don't have the same effects.",

There is some concern about the ketogenic diet when used long-term. When used for more than 2 years, the ketogenic diet has been linked with slowed growth, fractures, and kidney stones in children. Heart conditions: Use with caution. The ketogenic diet might worsen certain heart conditions. Diabetes: Following a very-low carbohydrate ketogenic diet might increase the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes. If you have diabetes, speak with a healthcare professional before starting the ketogenic diet. Acid reflux: Some ketogenic diets are high in fat. High-fat diets can worsen symptoms of acid reflux. High levels of fat in the blood: Some ketogenic diets are high in fat. Diets high in fat can increase levels of cholesterol and other fats called triglycerides. This might be a problem for people who already have high levels of these fats in the blood. Talk to your doctor before starting the ketogenic diet. Liver disease: The ketogenic diet might cause liver injury and may worsen symptoms of liver disease. Problems breaking down fats in the diet: The ketogenic diet forces the body to break down fat for energy. For people unable to break down fat, the ketogenic diet might lead to serious adverse effects, including coma or death. Kidney disease: The ketogenic diet may worsen kidney disease and has been linked with kidney stone development. Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis): Long-term use of the ketogenic diet may weaken the bones. Use caution if you are at risk for or have a history of osteoporosis.

Vaping products containing THC have been linked to serious lung injury. Regularly smoking cannabis may cause CHS and/or dependence. Pregnancy: Using cannabis is unsafe during pregnancy. Cannabis passes through the placenta and can slow the growth of the fetus and increase the risk for premature birth, stillbirth, childhood leukemia, abnormalities, or the need for intensive care after birth. It can also lead to lower intelligence and emotional problems in the child when they grow up. It also increases the risk for anemia and high blood pressure while pregnant. Breast-feeding: Using cannabis is likely unsafe while breast-feeding. The chemicals in cannabis pass into breastmilk and stay in breastmilk for longer than 6 weeks, even after cannabis use has been stopped. These chemicals might slow down the development of the baby. Avoid all cannabis use if planning to breastfeed. Bipolar disorder: Using cannabis might make manic symptoms worse in people with bipolar disorder. Heart disease: Cannabis might cause fast heartbeat and high blood pressure. It might also increase the risk of having heart attack. Allergies to fruits and vegetables: Cannabis might increase the risk of an allergic reaction in people with allergies to foods like tomatoes, bananas, and citrus fruit. Depression: Using cannabis might increase the risk for depression. It can also worsen symptoms of depression and increase thoughts about suicide in those who already have depression. Diabetes: Cannabis use might make it harder to control blood sugar levels. It might also increase the risk for long-term complications from diabetes. Until more is known, be cautious using cannabis. Epilepsy: High doses of cannabis might cause seizures in people with epilepsy. There have been several reports where high doses of cannabis have caused seizures. Weakened immune system: Because cannabis can be contaminated with fungus, there's some concern that using cannabis might put people with weakened immune systems at risk for fungal infections. Liver disease: It is unclear if cannabis worsens chronic liver disease. Until more is known, be cautious using cannabis. Lung diseases: Cannabis can make lung problems worse.

Iodine reduces thyroid hormone and can kill fungus, bacteria, and other microorganisms such as amoebas. Iodine deficiency is one of the most common and preventable world health problems. Most iodine is found in the ocean, where it is concentrated by sea life, particularly in seaweed. Iodine is taken by mouth to prevent and treat iodine deficiency and its consequences, including goiter and some thyroid disorders. A specific kind of iodine called potassium iodide is also US FDA approved to prevent thyroid damage after a radioactive accident. Iodine is also used for pink eye, gum infections, wound healing, and many other conditions, but there is limited scientific evidence to support many of these uses.",
        "uses": "Likely Effective for Iodine deficiency. Taking iodine supplements by mouth, including iodized salt, is effective for preventing and treating iodine deficiency. Radiation exposure. Taking iodine by mouth can protect the thyroid after exposure in a radiation emergency. But it should not be used for general protection against radiation. Possibly Effective for Pink eye. Using eye drops containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine seems to reduce the risk of pink eye in newborns. It also seems to help treat pink eye in adults. Foot sores in people with diabetes. Applying iodine to foot sores might help treat foot ulcers related to diabetes. Swelling (inflammation) of the lining of the uterus (endometritis). Washing the vagina with a solution containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine before a cesarean delivery reduces the risk of swelling of the uterus lining. A type of benign (non-cancerous) breast disease (fibrocystic breast disease). Taking molecular iodine, in a dose of about 3000-6000 mcg daily, reduces breast tenderness and pain. Lower doses of 1500 mcg daily don't seem to help. Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Rinsing the mouth with an iodine solution seems to prevent soreness and swelling inside the mouth caused by chemotherapy. A serious gum infection (periodontitis). Rinsing the mouth with an iodine solution during non-surgical treatments for gum infections can help reduce the depth of infected gum pockets. Infection after surgery. Applying iodine in the form of povidone-iodine before or during surgery reduces the risk of infections. But it's unclear how it compares to other options, such as chlorhexidine, for preventing infections. A life-threatening condition caused by excess of thyroid hormone (thyroid storm). Taking iodine by mouth in combination with other treatments can help treat thyroid storm. Lumps in the thyroid. Taking iodine by mouth can improve lumps on the thyroid called thyroid nodules.

Some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 0.8-1.2 mg daily might increase the risk for cancer or increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Folic acid 300-400 mcg daily is recommended during pregnancy to prevent certain birth defects. The maximum recommended amount of folic acid during pregnancy or breastfeeding is 800 mcg daily for those under 18 years of age and 1000 mcg daily for those over 18 years of age. Do not use more unless directed by a healthcare professional. Another form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe to take at a dose of up to 400 mcg daily when pregnant or breastfeeding. Children: It is likely safe for children to take folic acid by mouth in the recommended amounts for their age. But children should avoid taking folic acid in doses that are higher than the daily upper limits. These limits are 300 mcg for 1-3 years of age, 400 mcg for 4-8 years of age, 600 mcg for 9-13 years of age, and 800 mcg for 14-18 years of age. Another form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe in children. Procedures to widen narrowed arteries (angioplasty): Using folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 might worsen narrowed arteries. Folic acid should not be used by people recovering from this procedure. Cancer: Early research suggests that taking 0.8-1 mg of folic acid daily might increase the risk of cancer. Until more is known, people with a history of cancer should avoid high doses of folic acid. Seizure disorder: Taking folic acid supplements, especially in high doses, might make seizures worse in people with seizure disorders. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Taking folic acid supplements might improve certain lab tests in people with low vitamin B12 levels. This may make it seem like vitamin B12 deficiency is improved when it isn't. If left untreated, this could cause permanent nerve damage.",

        "name": "FLUORIDE",
        "overview": "Fluoride is a form of the chemical element fluorine. It occurs naturally in nature and is found in body tissues containing calcium, such as bones and teeth. Fluoride protects teeth from the bacteria in plaque. It also promotes new bone formation. This is different than most medicines used for weak bones (osteoporosis), which fight osteoporosis by keeping bone from being broken down. People commonly use fluoride to prevent cavities. It is also used for tooth plaque, a mild form of gum disease (gingivitis), osteoporosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of its other uses. The FDA warns that swallowing too much toothpaste can increase the risk for tooth staining. But this is likely more of a concern with long-term use rather than accidentally swallowing it just once. Also, starting June 2022, fluoride levels in bottled water cannot exceed 0.7 mg per liter and must be declared on the label.",
        "uses": "Effective for Cavities. Using fluoride in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other dental products, or consuming it in drinking water, reduces the risk of cavities in both baby teeth and permanent teeth. But it's not clear if taking fluoride supplements by mouth offers these benefits. Possibly Effective for Tooth plaque.Using toothpaste containing fluoride, especially when it also contains tin (stannous fluoride), seems to reduce the amount of plaque build-up on teeth. A mild form of gum disease (gingivitis). Using toothpaste containing fluoride, especially when it also contains tin (stannous fluoride), seems to reduce bleeding and swelling of the gums. Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Taking fluoride by mouth seems to increase bone mineral density, which is an indicator of bone strength. But it's not clear if it helps reduce the risk of fractures. There is interest in using fluoride for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.",
        "side_effects": "When taken by mouth: Fluoride is commonly consumed in public drinking water. It is likely safe when consumed in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10 mg of elemental fluoride daily. Taking high doses, long-term can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems. When applied to the teeth: Fluoride is likely safe when used in toothpastes and mouthwashes, and when applied by dentists.",

Flaxseeds also contain phytoestrogens called lignans, which are similar to the hormone estrogen. The fiber in flaxseed is found in the seed coat. When taken before eating, it seems to make people feel less hungry. It might also help limit how much cholesterol the body absorbs from food. Flaxseed is used for constipation, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and swelling of the kidneys in people with lupus. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil have different effects. For information about the oil, see Flaxseed Oil.",

The benefits of fish oil seem to come from its omega-3 fatty acid content. Fish that are especially rich in these oils include mackerel, herring, tuna, and salmon. The body doesn't produce many of its own omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce pain and swelling, and also prevent the blood from clotting easily. Some fish oil products are approved by the FDA as prescription medications to lower triglycerides levels. Fish oil is also available as a supplement. Fish oil supplements do not contain the same amount of fish oil as prescription products, so they cannot be used in place of prescription products. Fish oil supplements are sometimes used for heart health and mental health, but there is no strong evidence to support most of these uses. Do not confuse fish oil with EPA, DHA, cod liver oil, flaxseed oil, krill oil, or shark liver oil. See the separate listings for these topics.",
        "uses": "Effective for High levels of fats called triglycerides in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia). Taking certain fish oil prescription drugs by mouth, including Lovaza, Omtryg, and Epanova, reduces very high triglyceride levels. These products are most often taken at a dose of 4 grams daily. While some non-prescription fish oil supplements might also help, these products contain less omega-3 fatty acids than the prescription fish oil products. People would need to take as many as 12 capsules of fish oil supplements daily to get the same effect as prescription fish oil. Possibly Effective for A procedure to open a blocked or narrowed blood vessel (angioplasty). Taking fish oil by mouth decreases the rate of blood vessel re-blockage by up to 45% when taken for at least 3 weeks before an angioplasty and continued for one month after. Involuntary weight loss in people who are very ill (cachexia or wasting syndrome). Taking a high dose of fish oil by mouth seems to slow weight loss in some cancer patients. Low doses of fish oil don't seem to have this effect. Kidney damage caused by the drug cyclosporine. Taking fish oil seems to prevent kidney damage in people taking cyclosporine. Fish oil also seems to improve kidney function in people who recently rejected a transplanted kidney and are taking cyclosporine. Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). Taking fish oil, alone or with vitamin B12 or vitamin E, can improve painful periods and reduce the need for pain medications for menstrual cramps. Nausea and vomiting caused by an infection of the intestines. Taking fish oil during pregnancy seems to reduce the risk of the child having nausea and vomiting from an infection of the intestines. Heart failure. Consuming higher amounts of fish oil from foods has been linked with a lower risk of heart failure. Eating 1-2 servings of non-fried fish per week is recommended.

But children who eat fish at least once weekly from the age of 1-2 years seem to have a lower risk of developing eczema. Irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation). Eating fatty fish or taking fish oil supplements by mouth does not reduce the risk of irregular heartbeat. In fact, the risk of irregular heartbeat might be increased in some people taking fish oil supplements. A lung disease that affects newborns (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Giving fish oil by mouth to premature infants doesn't seem to reduce the infant's risk of developing this lung disease. Long-term blood flow problems in the brain (cerebrovascular diseases). Eating fish might reduce the risk of cerebrovascular disease. But taking fish oil supplements by mouth doesn't have this effect. Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Taking fish oil supplements by mouth does not improve most memory or thinking skills in older people, young adults, or children. A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori). Taking fish oil supplements by mouth does not seem to improve H. pylori infections when compared to standard medications. Kidney transplant.

        "overview": "Calcium is an essential nutrient found in many foods, such as dairy products. The bones and teeth contain over 99% of all calcium in the human body. Bones are always breaking down and rebuilding. Calcium is needed for this process, but the concentration of calcium in the body tends to decline with age. Taking extra calcium helps the bones rebuild and stay strong. The heart, nerves, and blood-clotting systems also need calcium. People commonly take calcium by mouth for the treatment and prevention of low calcium levels, muscle cramps, osteoporosis, softening of the bones, and PMS. It is also used for high blood pressure, cancer, stroke, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.

People most commonly use vitamin A for treating vitamin A deficiency. It is also used for aging skin, acne, HIV/AIDS, cataracts, child development, infections, and many other conditions.",
        "uses": "Effective for Vitamin A deficiency. Taking vitamin A by mouth is effective for preventing and treating vitamin A deficiency. Possibly Effective for Aging skin. Applying vitamin A (retinol) on the skin improves skin color, flexibility, and wrinkles in people with aging skin. It isn't clear whether non-prescription retinol works as well as prescription products such as tretinoin (Renova). A lung disease that affects newborns (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Giving vitamin A as a shot seems to reduce the risk of this lung disease in infants born with a low birth weight. Vitamin A shots can only be given by a healthcare provider. It isn't clear whether giving vitamin A by mouth is helpful. Diarrhea. Giving vitamin A by mouth to young children who are at risk of vitamin A deficiency seems to prevent diarrhea. It isn't clear whether taking vitamin A while breastfeeding can help to prevent diarrhea in the nursing infant. Measles. Taking vitamin A by mouth seems to reduce the risk of measles, its complications, and death in young children with vitamin A deficiency. Ability to see in low-light conditions. Taking vitamin A by mouth during pregnancy seems to reduce night blindness by 37% in malnourished adults. Vitamin A might work better for this condition when taken with zinc. White patches inside the mouth that are usually caused by smoking (oral leukoplakia). Taking high-dose vitamin A by mouth can help treat these lesions. Death from any cause. Taking high-dose vitamin A by mouth reduces the risk of death in children under 5 years of age who are at risk for vitamin A deficiency. Taking vitamin A doesn't seem to reduce the risk of death in healthy adults. Complications after childbirth. Taking vitamin A by mouth before, during, and after pregnancy reduces diarrhea and the risk of death after giving birth in malnourished adults. An inherited eye condition that causes poor night vision and loss of side vision (retinitis pigmentosa). Taking vitamin A by mouth can slow the progression of an eye disease that causes damage to the retina. A type of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis). Taking vitamin A by mouth daily for 2 months can reduce symptoms in adults with ulcerative colitis. Skin wrinkles from sun damage. Applying non-prescription vitamin A (retinol) serum to the skin improves skin smoothness and wrinkles in females with sun-damaged skin. It might work as well as the prescription products that are approved by the FDA for treating skin wrinkles, such as tretinoin (Renova). Possibly Ineffective for Prone to allergies and allergic reactions (atopic disease). Giving a single dose of vitamin A by mouth to infants does not seem to prevent atopy. Death of an unborn or premature baby. Taking vitamin A by mouth before, during, or after pregnancy does not seem to prevent infant death during the first year of life. Also giving vitamin A by mouth directly to infants doesn't seem to prevent infant death. Infection of the intestines by parasites. Giving a single dose of vitamin A by mouth to children taking medicine to treat intestinal parasites doesn't seem to prevent reinfection. The most serious type of skin cancer (melanoma). Taking a high dose of vitamin A by mouth doesn't seem to improve survival in people with melanoma. Miscarriage. Taking vitamin A by mouth, alone or in combination with other vitamins, before or during early pregnancy doesn't reduce the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth. Blood infection (sepsis). Giving vitamin A to premature infants doesn't seem to prevent sepsis. Tuberculosis. Taking vitamin A by mouth doesn't seem to improve symptoms or decrease the risk of death in people with this condition. Likely InEffective for Head and neck cancer. Taking vitamin A by mouth does not reduce the risk of developing new tumors or improve survival in people with head and neck cancer. HIV transmission. Taking vitamin A by mouth does not lower the risk of passing HIV to the fetus during pregnancy, to newborns during delivery, or to infants during breastfeeding. Taking vitamin A supplements during pregnancy might actually increase the risk of passing HIV to babies through breast milk. Infection of the lower airways. Taking vitamin A by mouth does not prevent or reduce symptoms of lower airway infections in children. Also, taking vitamin A while breast-feeding does not seem to prevent these infections in nursing infants. There is interest in using vitamin A for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.",
        "side_effects": "When taken by mouth: Vitamin A is likely safe when taken in amounts less than 10,000 units (3,000 mcg) daily. Vitamin A is available in two forms: pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) and provitamin A (carotenoids). The maximum daily dose relates to only pre-formed vitamin A. Pre-formed vitamin A is possibly unsafe when taken in doses greater than 10,000 units (3,000 mcg) daily. Higher doses might increase the risk of side effects. Long-term use of large amounts might cause serious side effects including mental changes. When applied to the skin: Vitamin A is possibly safe when used short-term. Retinol 0.5% serum has been used daily for up to 12 weeks without serious side effects.",

Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Vitamin A is likely safe when taken in recommended amounts of less than 10,000 units (3,000 mcg) of pre-formed vitamin A daily. Larger amounts are possibly unsafe and can cause birth defects. Monitor vitamin A intake from all sources during the first three months of pregnancy. Forms of vitamin A are found in several foods including animal liver, some fortified breakfast cereals, and dietary supplements. Children: Vitamin A is likely safe when taken in the recommended amounts. The maximum amounts of vitamin A that are safe for children are based on age. Vitamin A is possibly unsafe for children when taken by mouth in high doses. Taking high doses can cause side effects, including irritability, sleepiness, diarrhea, and other problems. Excessive use of alcohol: Drinking alcohol might increase vitamin A's potentially harmful effects on the liver. Disorders in which the body does not absorb fat properly: People with conditions that affect fat absorption are not able to absorb vitamin A properly. These conditions include celiac disease, short gut syndrome, jaundice, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic disease, and cirrhosis of the liver. If you have one of these conditions, take water-soluble forms of vitamin A, called carotenoids, instead. Iron deficiency: Iron deficiency might affect the body's ability to use vitamin A. Liver disease: Too much vitamin A might make liver disease worse. Do not take vitamin A supplements if you have liver disease. Malnutrition: In people with severe protein malnutrition, taking vitamin A supplements might result in having too much vitamin A in the body. Zinc deficiency: Zinc deficiency might cause symptoms of vitamin A deficiency. Taking a combination of vitamin A and zinc supplements might be necessary to improve this condition.",
        "interactions": "Major Interaction Do not take this combination Medications for skin conditions (Retinoids) interacts with VITAMIN ASome medications for skin conditions are made from vitamin A. Taking vitamin A and these medications together could cause toxic effects.Moderate Interaction Be cautious with this combination Antibiotics (Tetracycline antibiotics) interacts with VITAMIN ATaking very large amounts of vitamin A along with tetracyclines can increase the chance of a serious side effect called intracranial hypertension. But taking normal doses of vitamin A along with tetracyclines does not seem to cause this problem. Do not take large amounts of vitamin A if you are taking antibiotics.Medications that can harm the liver (Hepatotoxic drugs) interacts with VITAMIN ATaking large amounts of vitamin A might harm the liver. Some medications can also harm the liver. Taking high doses of vitamin A along with a medication that can harm the liver might increase the risk of liver damage.Warfarin (Coumadin) interacts with VITAMIN AWarfarin is used to slow blood clotting. Large amounts of vitamin A can also slow blood clotting. Taking vitamin A along with warfarin can increase the chances of bruising and bleeding. Be sure to have your blood checked regularly. The dose of your warfarin might need to be changed.",
        "dosing": "Vitamin A is an important nutrient. It is found in many foods, including fruits, vegetables, eggs, whole milk, meat, and fish. The amount that should be consumed on a daily basis is called the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA is 900 mcg daily for males and 700 mcg daily for females. While pregnant, the RDA is 770 mcg daily. While breast-feeding, the RDA is 1300 mcg daily. In children, the RDA depends on age. In supplements, vitamin A is available in two forms: pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) and provitamin A (carotenoids). For products that contain both, only count the amount of pre-formed vitamin A to determine what is safe. Vitamin A is also available in many topical products, including creams, serums, and lotions. Speak with a healthcare provider to find out what type of product and dose might be best for a specific condition."

        "name": "VINPOCETINE",
        "overview": "Vinpocetine is a man-made chemical similar to a substance found in the periwinkle plant (Vinca minor). In Europe, it's sold as a drug called Cavinton. Vinpocetine might increase blood flow to the brain and protect brain cells (neurons) against injury. People use vinpocetine for memory, dementia, stroke, hearing loss, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. In the US, vinpocetine is allowed to be included in dietary supplements, but its status is controversial and may change. The FDA has yet to make a final ruling. In 2019, the FDA issued a warning for those who are pregnant or may become pregnant to avoid vinpocetine due to safety concerns.",
        "uses": "Possibly Effective for Diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, that interfere with thinking (dementia). Taking vinpocetine by mouth for up to 4 months might slightly improve thinking skills in people with dementia. But it's not clear if it helps long-term. There is interest in using vinpocetine for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.",

        "name": "XYLITOL",
        "overview": "Xylitol is a natural sugar alcohol found in plants, including many fruits and vegetables. It has a sweet taste and is often used as a sugar substitute. Xylitol tastes sweet but, unlike sugar, it doesn't cause tooth decay. It reduces levels of decay-causing bacteria in saliva and also acts against some bacteria that cause ear infections. It's widely used in sugar-free chewing gums, mints, and other candies. In the US, products that contain xylitol are allowed to state that they reduce the risk for cavities. People also use xylitol to prevent tooth plaque, ear infection, dry mouth, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Xylitol can be toxic to dogs. If your dog eats a product that contains xylitol, take them to a veterinarian immediately.",
        "uses": "Likely Effective for Cavities. Using xylitol-containing products in the mouth, such as chewing gum, candies, and toothpaste, reduces the risk for cavities in adults and children 5 years and older. It's unclear if it helps prevent cavities in children younger than 5 years old. Possibly Effective for Ear infection (otitis media). Giving xylitol-containing products such as a chewing gum, lozenges, or syrups daily after meals to preschool children seems to reduce the risk for ear infections. But giving xylitol right after a respiratory infection has started doesn't seem to prevent ear infections. There is interest in using xylitol for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.",
        "side_effects": "When taken by mouth: Xylitol is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when used in chewing gums, candies, lozenges, toothpastes, and mouth rinses in amounts up to about 50 grams daily. It might cause diarrhea and gas in some people. Taking high doses of xylitol is possibly unsafe. Using very high doses long-term might cause tumors. When used as a rinse in the nose: Xylitol is possibly safe when mixed in water to clear the sinuses.",
