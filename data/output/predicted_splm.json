        "name": "LICORICE",
        "overview": "Licorice is an herb that grows in parts of Europe and Asia. Licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, which can cause side effects when eaten in large amounts. The chemicals in licorice are thought to decrease swelling, decrease cough, and increase the chemicals in our body that heal ulcers. Many licorice products made in the U.S. actually don't contain licorice. They contain anise oil, which has the smell and taste of black licorice. Licorice is used for eczema, swelling of the liver, mouth sores, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using licorice for COVID-19.",
        "uses": "Possibly Effective for Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Applying a gel containing licorice three times daily for 2 weeks seems to reduce redness, swelling, and itching from eczema. Canker sores. Applying a patch containing licorice and using licorice mouth rinses seem to help reduce pain and speed up healing of canker sores. Side effects in people after breathing tube removal. Sucking on a licorice lozenge or gargling with a licorice fluid shortly before placement of a breathing tube seems to help prevent cough and sore throat from occurring when the tube is removed. There is interest in using licorice for a number of other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful.",
        "side_effects": "When taken by mouth: Licorice is likely safe for most people when eaten in typical food amounts. Licorice that has had the chemical glycyrrhizin removed is possibly safe when taken in doses up to 4.5 grams daily for up to 4 months. Licorice that contains glycyrrhizin is possibly unsafe when consumed in large amounts or for a long time. Eating licorice 5 grams or more daily for several weeks can cause severe side effects including heart attack. People who have heart disease, kidney disease, or high blood pressure are more sensitive to it. Ingesting large amounts of licorice from candy, lozenges, or tea might also cause serious side effects. When applied to the skin: Applying gel with licorice root extract 2% is possibly safe for up to 2 weeks. It is possibly safe to use a licorice mouth rinse for up to one week.",

Pregnancy: It is unsafe to take licorice when pregnant. It might cause a miscarriage or early delivery. Eating about 250 grams of licorice per week seems to increase the risk of early delivery. Breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information available about the safety of taking licorice when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Heart conditions: Licorice can cause the body to store water, and this can make heart failure worse. Licorice can also increase the risk of irregular heartbeat. Don't consume licorice if you have a heart condition. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Licorice might act like estrogen in the body. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use licorice. High blood pressure: Licorice can raise blood pressure. Don't consume large amounts of licorice if you have high blood pressure. A muscle condition caused by nerve problems (hypertonia): Licorice can lower potassium levels in the blood. This can make hypertonia worse. Avoid licorice if you have hypertonia. Low potassium levels in the blood (hypokalemia): Licorice can lower potassium levels in the blood. If your potassium is already low, licorice might make it too low. Don't use licorice if you have this condition. Kidney disease: Consuming large amounts of licorice could make kidney disease worse. Sexual problems: Consuming large amounts of licorice can lower interest in sex. It can also worsen erectile dysfunction (ED) by lowering levels of testosterone. Surgery: Licorice might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop taking licorice at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",
        "interactions": "Moderate Interaction Be cautious with this combination Digoxin (Lanoxin) interacts with LICORICELarge amounts of licorice can decrease potassium levels in the body.

Licorice might change how these pumps work and change how much medication stays in the body. In some cases, this might change the effects and side effects of a medication.Minor Interaction Be watchful with this combination Methotrexate (Trexall, others) interacts with LICORICELicorice might decrease how quickly the body breaks down methotrexate. This might increase the effects and side effects of methotrexate.",
        "dosing": "Licorice is available in many different types of products, including candies, lozenges, teas, chewing tobacco, creams, gels, patches, sprays, mouth washes, and others. Licorice extract has most often been used by adults in doses of 100-990 mg by mouth daily for 2-24 weeks. Licorice naturally contains a chemical called glycyrrhizin. The amount of glycyrrhizin usually ranges from 1% to 12%. Most of the side effects from licorice are caused by this chemical. Licorice products that have had glycyrrhizin removed are sometimes called deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL). Many licorice products manufactured in the U.S. actually don't contain any licorice. Instead, they contain anise oil, which has the smell and taste of black licorice."

Wild indigo is used for infections such as diphtheria, influenza (flu), the common cold, other upper respiratory tract infections, malaria, typhoid, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Do not confuse wild indigo with other plants that are often referred to as indigo. Also, don't confuse wild indigo with indigo carmine. Indigo carmine is a dye that is created in a lab and is used for many industrial purposes.",

        "dosing": "The appropriate dose of wild indigo depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for wild indigo. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using."

        "overview": "Senna is the fruit (pod) or leaf of the plant Senna alexandrina. It is approved in the US as a laxative for short-term treatment of constipation. Senna contains many chemicals called sennosides. Sennosides irritate the lining of the bowel, which causes a laxative effect. Senna is an FDA-approved over-the-counter (OTC) laxative. It is used to treat constipation and also to clear the bowel before procedures such as colonoscopy. People also use senna for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hemorrhoids, weight loss, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.",
